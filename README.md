<h2>You may be wondering. Why the V3.2? </h2>
Well the reason is because I see the development of my personal portfolio site as an active, ongoing process. Every now and then I decided to re-do my entire site in order to make it cleaner, while 
incorperating the new skills i've learned since the last version. 

This version of my portfolio site was my first time using the frontend framework: React. V1 of my site took me a whole summer (I wish I was exagerating) whereas V3 (the current version) took me only 5 days! If that isn't progress I don't know what is.
