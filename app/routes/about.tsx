                Thomas was born in Cambridge UK, and thereafter, he lived in
                both Canada and the UAE throughout his childhood. He moved to
                the UAE for high school, and while there he obtained his IGCSE
                certificate, receiving a 9 out of a possible 9 in Physics, and
                also earning himself the Physics award for his year group. He
                carried this same high achievement with him into the IB program,
                where he finished with a total IB score of 41/45 putting him
                within the top 1% of international students worldwide, and once
                again, earning himself the Physics award for IB due to his high
                achievement and interest. Thomas is now pursuing a bachelors
                degree in Electrical Engineering at McGill University in
                Montreal Canada, McGill University was ranked as the 30th best
